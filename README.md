Purpose: I want to get better at Rust, so I decided to build some common CS data structures in Rust.

Data structures
- [ ] Array
- Linked Lists
    - [ ] Stack
    - [ ] Queue
    - [ ] Singly linked list
    - [ ] Doubly linked list
- Trees
    - [x] Binary search tree
    - [ ] Red-black tree
    - [ ] Min/max heaps
- Graphs?
